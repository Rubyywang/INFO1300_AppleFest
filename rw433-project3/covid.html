            <p>During the day, a couple of farms will have pop-up farm stands to sell pre-packaged goods. This will generally take place in the afternoon. The goods include pre-packaged apples, Cider, and other fall produce. This is to promote the availablity of grab-and-go, to minimize the contact between farms and people</p>
            <p>Each stand will have markers to create lines with 6 inches of distance between customers. All customers and farmers will be required to wear masks.</p>
            <p>Hand sanitizer will be available, but it is highly encouaged that you bring your own. There will be some stationed around the Ithaca Commons.</p>
